3. Add the following:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL | https://mcdonalds-malaysia-api.onrender.com |
| NODE_VERSION | 18 |

### Important Notes:
- Variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser
- Never store sensitive data in `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables
- Changes require redeployment to take effect

## üìù Configuration Details

### netlify.toml Configuration

The `netlify.toml` file configures:

- **Build settings**: Node version, build command
- **Environment variables**: API URL
- **Headers**: Security and caching
- **Redirects**: API proxy and routing
- **Plugins**: Next.js integration

### Next.js on Netlify

Netlify automatically:
- Detects Next.js framework
- Configures serverless functions
- Sets up image optimization
- Handles ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Verify Deployment

After deployment, you'll get a URL like: `https://amazing-site-123.netlify.app`

### 2. Test API Connection

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
// Test API connection
fetch('https://your-site.netlify.app/api/health')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log('API Status:', data))
```

### 3. Check All Pages

Test critical paths:
- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Chat interface works
- [ ] Map displays correctly
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Location services

### 4. Monitor Performance

Use Netlify Analytics or browser DevTools:
- Page load time
- API response times
- Bundle size
- Error logs

## üéØ Production Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Custom domain configured
- [ ] SSL certificate active
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] API connection verified
- [ ] Error pages configured
- [ ] Analytics/monitoring setup
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] SEO meta tags added

## üåê Custom Domain Setup

### Adding a Custom Domain

1. **In Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Go to "Domain settings"
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `mcdonalds-locator.com`)

2. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Add Netlify's nameservers to your domain registrar
   - Or use CNAME/A records:
     ```
     Type: CNAME
     Name: www
     Value: amazing-site-123.netlify.app
     ```

3. **SSL Certificate**:
   - Netlify provides free SSL
   - Automatic renewal
   - Force HTTPS in settings

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   ```bash
   # Clear cache and retry
   npm clean-install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **API Connection Errors**
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set correctly
   - Check CORS settings on backend
   - Test API directly: https://mcdonalds-malaysia-api.onrender.com/health

3. **404 Errors on Routes**
   - Ensure `netlify.toml` has proper redirects
   - Check Next.js routing configuration

4. **Slow Initial Load**
